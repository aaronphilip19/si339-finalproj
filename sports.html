                            <p>This is definitely my favourite sporting experience of all time and do not expect this to ever be topped. I remember the sheer amount of jubilation amongst my family and my friends in Dubai when we finally lifted the cricket WC after a long dry spell.</p>

                            <p>Having been a Lebron fan ever since I watched basketball, this was the best year of basketball I could remember. With the odds stacked against the cavs, winning this championship in 4-3 comeback fashion made the 2016 finals one I won't ever forget</p>

                            <p>Tennis was one of the first sports I learnt and Federer was the athlete who made me fall in love with the game. Federer at Wimbledon is a sporting spectacle I never missed out on and his 15th Grand Slam was a crowning moment.</p>

                            <p>Although I am a Brazil fan, this is up there in terms of sporting experiences for me as the 2022 World Cup Final might be the single-most high stakes final I've watched. Watching the greatest athlete of all time imo, Messi, win his first world cup is something I hope to share with my kids one day.</p>

                            <p>Lebron James has been my favourite athlete for as long as I could remember. At the age of 10, I had his Miami Heat jersey before I even knew about basketball. His sheer dominance and consistency are attributes that define him for me.</p>

                            <p>Mahendra Singh Dhoni is my favourite cricketer of all time. He was India's captian since 2007 and led them to their 2nd world cup in 2011. As an athlete, he has had the most significant impact on me as a person through admiration of his cool and calm persona exemplified through his leadership.</p>

                            <p>Alexis Sanchez is my one of my favourite footballers as he was my favourite club Arsenal's best player between the years of 2014 and 2018. This was around the time I started watching football every weekend.</p>

                            <p>Chad Le Clos is my favourite swimmer of all time. Swimmming was the first sport I learnt and Le Clos was memorable to me as he used to dominate the freestyle category, which was my personal best category as well.</p>
